# chromatin-n-out
Prototyping visualization & interaction methods for intuitive hierarchical navigation of 3D data that have a linear component (i.e., 3D chromatin models).

## todo
- [x] rectangular widget mvp
    - [x] single path selection
    - [x] individual levels selections can be edited/redefined (only one selection per level for now)
    - [x] selecting in both directions (0 -> N, N -> 0)
- [ ] arc version of the selection widget
    - [ ] multiple selections: each spawning a new tree
- [ ] add 3D model rendering (probably threejs as baseline)
    - [x] include some basic threejs scene
    - [ ] connect the shown 3D with selection widgets
- [ ] non-uniform, interactive and fluid layouting of 3D+widget
