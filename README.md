# chromatin-n-out
Prototyping visualization & interaction methods for intuitive hierarchical navigation of 3D data that have a linear component (i.e., 3D chromatin models).

## todo
- [ ] rectangular widget mvp
    - [x] single path selection
    - [ ] individual levels selections can be edited/redefined (only one selection per level for now)
        - almost done but there's a bug
    - [x] selecting in both directions (0 -> N, N -> 0)
- [ ] arc version of the selection widget
    - [ ] multiple selections: each spawning a new tree
- [ ] add 3D model rendering (probably threejs as baseline)
- [ ] non-uniform, interactive and fluid layouting of 3D+widget
